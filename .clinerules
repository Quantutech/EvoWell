# Senior Engineer Guardrails & Performance Rules

## 1. Planning Phase (Mandatory)
- BEFORE writing any code, you MUST perform a "System Impact Analysis."
- Create or update a `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` file in the root.
- The plan must list:
  - Root cause of the bug.
  - Files to be modified.
  - Potential side effects on the 30k+ line architecture.
- STOP and wait for my approval after the plan is created.

## 2. Resource & Token Optimization
- DO NOT read files blindly. Use `grep` or `list_files` to find specific keywords.
- For files >500 lines, use the `search` tool to find specific functions instead of reading the entire file.
- Avoid "Refactoring for the sake of refactoring." Only touch code directly related to the fix.

## 3. Preservation & Branding
- NEVER modify brand-related constants (Company names, Logos, UI Themes) unless explicitly asked.
- DO NOT remove comments, JSDoc, or TODOs left by other developers.
- Maintain the existing design patterns (e.g., if we use Functional Components, don't introduce Classes).

## 4. Problem Solving Protocol
- TRACE THE DATA: If a UI component is buggy, check the API layer and State Management first. Do not just patch the "symptom" in the UI.
- TYPE SAFETY: Always maintain TypeScript integrity. Update interfaces/types project-wide if a data structure changes.
- NO HALLUCINATIONS: If you cannot find where a variable is defined, ASK me instead of assuming it exists or creating a dummy value.

## 5. Verification
- After every fix, you must run the local build command (e.g., `npm run build` or `npm run lint`) to ensure no regressions.
- If the fix involves a logic change, suggest a 5-line unit test to verify it.
